Code and notes for mechatronics, Winter 2015

This repository contains the code and notes for our final project for mechatronics, Winter 2015.

Group members are:
Jordan Argyle
Trevor Buckner
Jordan Calvert
Mikkel Unrau

This is a public project, meaning that anybody can search for and find it, and therefore I feel it
not a good idea to include too much information about ourselves.

Included in this repository:

* this readme file
* Our primary programming project, including our .c and build information
* Data sheets for:
  - Our microcontroller
  - Sensors
  - Power regulator
  - 
* Notes and schematics
* CAD files
* .stl files

If you are not one of the 4 people listed above, please do not copy, add to, or plagiarize this
project. We are but poor college students who cannot afford private repositories. Thanks!
